# **Grid-Based Terrain Generation System for Unity3D**

⚠️ **Work In Progress**

In this repository, you can find a prototype of a terrain generation system for simple `grid-based terrains` (built with unity tilemap grid system).

This system can be used as a foundation or starting point for games that require this type of terrain, such as city builders, RTS games, and tower defense games.

The system randomly generates terrain proprerties and save them in tilemaps (each tile will have a certain property)
